            The current job scenario has turned out to be very unpredictable for the engineering students due to some mild or not so mild global economic mistakes, which is indeed a matter of concern. Thinking too much about these things may prove counter-productive for the students.
            <br />
But the students of our institution need not worry so much about the things going on around them, and focus on their career goals. Every student has his/her “dream” company/institution but has to compromise due to lack of experience as they have no one to guide them.
<br />
Students’ Alumni Interaction Cell, NIT Durgapur has launched an initiative, Alumni Recruit Connect which will facilitate the above purpose and help the students to gain some insight into the industry and prepare themselves accordingly for the upcoming challenges.
<br />
Now, how will that happen, who will guide, whom to approach, don’t worry. The ones who were there in the same boat few years back as you are now, the alumni of NIT Durgapur, will help you in this daunting mission.
